# Contributor Agreement
Before contributing to RSC, please transfer your copyright to the project.  The Free
Software Foundation also does this with contributions to their projects (e.g. GNU),
and they explain why [here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-assign.en.html).

## Do you currently own the copyright?

Here are some situations in which you do _not_ own the copyright to your software:

1. You are an employee and have signed an agreement that assigns the copyright for
software which you develop to your employer.  Note that, under some agreements,
_this may extend to software that you developed on your own time, even if it is
unrelated to your employer's line of business_.
2. You are a contractor who has developed the software as a "work for hire" under an
agreement that assigns the copyright to whoever paid you for the software.
3. You obtained the software from somewhere else, such as another open-source project.
If you didn't write it _yourself_, you don't own the copyright unless it was explicitly
transferred to you, in the same manner as requested by this agreement.

If you don't own the copyright, you will need to get a waiver from whoever does.  Please
email rsc-agreements@pentennea.com and explain what software you plan to contribute and
who owns the copyright.

## Transferring copyright to the project

You must own the copyright to the software (or have developed it yourself, if you have
also obtained a waiver from the copyright owner) before signing this agreement.
