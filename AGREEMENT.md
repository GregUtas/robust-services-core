# Robust Services Core: Contributor Agreement
Before contributing to RSC, please assign the copyright for your work to the project.
The Free Software Foundation also does this with contributions to their projects (e.g.
GNU), and they explain why [here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-assign.en.html).

## Do you own the copyright?

Here are some situations in which you do _not_ own the copyright to your software:

1. You are an employee who signed an agreement which assigns the copyright for
software that you develop to your employer.  _Note that this may extend to software
that you developed on your own time, even if it is unrelated to your employer's line
of business_.
2. You are a contractor who developed the software as a "work for hire" under an
agreement that assigns the copyright to whoever paid you for the software.
3. You got the software from somewhere else, such as another open-source project
or an online article.  If you didn't write it _yourself_, you don't own the copyright
(unless it was assigned to you, in the same manner as requested by this agreement).

If you do not own the copyright, you need to get a waiver from the owner.  Please
email rsc-agreements@pentennea.com and explain what software you plan to contribute
and who owns the copyright.

## Assigning the copyright to the project

You must own the copyright to the software (or have developed it yourself, if you have
also obtained a waiver from the copyright owner) before signing this agreement.
