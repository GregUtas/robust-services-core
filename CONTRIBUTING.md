# How to contribute to Robust Services Core

Thanks for your interest!  This document describes different ways that you can contribute.

## Asking a question
Questions are useful because they can identify where documentation needs to be improved.
Send questions to Greg Utas (greg@pentennea.com).

## Collaboration
To contribute in other ways, you must become a collaborator.  Send an email to Greg Utas
(greg@pentennea.com) to be invited to the repository.

The other ways to contribute involve the use of GitHub issues, which are labelled as follows:

Label | Meaning
------|--------
`application` | focuses on software in the `mb`, `cb`, `pots`, `sn`, `an`, `rn`, or `on` directory
`blocked` | must wait for the completion of another item
`bug` | something that needs to be fixed
`core` | focuses on software in the `nb`, `nw`, `sb`, `cn`, or `rsc` directory
`core tools` | focuses on software in the `nt` or `st` directory
`c++ tools` | focuses on software in the `ct` or `subs` directory
`design` | discussed in [_RSC Software Design_](/docs/RSC-Software-Design.pdf)
`documentation` | additions or changes to documents or code comments
`duplicate` | already described in another issue
`enhancement` | a capability that should be added
`help wanted` | an issue where collaboration is especially sought
`invalid/declined` | will not be implemented
`question` | something that should probably go in a FAQ
`1` | a day's effort once reasonably familiar with the software
`2` | several day's effort once reasonably familiar with the software
`3` | around a week's effort once reasonably familiar with the software
`4` | several week's effort once reasonbly familiar with the software
`5` | a major project

If you are a new contributor, you may want to start with an item labelled `1` or `2`.

## Reporting a bug
Bugs are tracked using issues.  Choose a descriptive title and appropriate labels for the
issue.  Describe what you did and how the results differed from what you expected.  Attach
a console file and, if possible, a test script and/or the output from a trace tool.

## Suggesting an enhancement
Enhancements are tracked using issues.  Choose a descriptive title and appropriate labels
for the issue.  If you plan to implement the enhancement yourself, describe what you plan
to achieve.  If you want someone else to implement the enhancement, you may need to provide
more detail to ensure that what gets implemented is actually what you wanted.

## Writing code
Before working on code
- Make sure that the change has been captured as an issue.
- Ask to be assigned to the issue so that other contributors can see what is already being
worked on.
- Read the [coding guidelines](/docs/RSC-Coding-Guidelines.md) and the [second chapter]
(/docs/RCS-chapter-2.pdf) of *Robust Communications Software*.
