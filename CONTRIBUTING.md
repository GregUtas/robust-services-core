# How to contribute to Robust Services Core

Thanks for your interest in contributing!  The following sections describe different ways
that you can contribute.

## Asking a question
Questions are useful because they can identify where documentation needs to be improved.
Send questions to Greg Utas (greg@pentennea.com).

## Becoming a collaborator
To contribute in other ways, you must first become a collaborator.  Send an email to Greg
Utas (greg@pentennea.com) to be invited to the repository.

## Reporting a bug
Bugs are tracked as issues.  Choose a descriptive title and appropriate labels for the
issue.  Describe what you did and how the results differed from what you expected.  Attach
a console file and, if possible, a test script and/or trace tool output.

## Suggesting an enhancement
Enhancements are tracked as issues.  Choose a descriptive title and appropriate labels
for the issue.  If you plan to implement the enhancement yourself, describe what you want
to achieve.  If you want someone else to implement the enhancement, you may need to provide
more detail to ensure they implement what you actually want.

## Writing code
Before working on code, make sure that the change has been captured as an issue (a bug or
enhancement).  Ask to be assigned to the issue so that other contributors can see what is
already being addressed.

Please consult the [coding guidelines](/docs/RSC-Coding-Guidelines.md).  You should also
be familiar with the material in the [second chapter](/docs/RCS-chapter-2.pdf) of *Robust
Communications Software*.
