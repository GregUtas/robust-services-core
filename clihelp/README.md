# CLI Documentation

This directory contains supplementary help files for CLI increments.  Only the CLI
itself, and the `>ct` increment, currently have such help files.  However, the CLI
framework ensures that each command provides basic help information.

* `>help <incr> full` causes the file `cli.<incr>.txt` to be written to the console.
* `>help full` writes `cli.txt` to the console.
