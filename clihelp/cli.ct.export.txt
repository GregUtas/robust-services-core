The options are specified in a string that contains any of the following:
  n (display namespace view)
  c (display canonical file view: items sorted in a fixed order)
  o (display original file view: items shown in their original order)
  h (display class hierarchy)
  s (include statistics, such as the number of reads and writes)
If no options are entered, they default to "nchs".
