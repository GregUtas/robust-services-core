# Robust Services Core: C++ Static Analysis Tools

The C++ static analysis tools are implemented in the `ct` increment,
which is entered with the CLI command `>ct`.  See the [CLI help
file](/docs/output/help.cli.txt) for the commands available in the `ct`
increment.  The commands can also be found by entering `>help ct` for
a brief summary, or `>help ct full` for a more detailed explanation.

The contents of the code library must be defined before any of the commands
can be used. This can be done with `>read buildlib`.

As the library is built, `#include` relationships are noted.  This allows
`#include` dependencies to be analyzed by the operators `us`, `ub`, `as`,
`ab`, `ca`, `ns`, and `nb`, which are described in the full help documentation.

Some commands cannot be used until the code has been parsed.  The command
`>parse - $files` will parse all of the files in the library.  If a file has
not been parsed, this will occur if you enter a command for which this is a
prerequisite.  Commands that require parsing include

* `>check`, to check for violations of C++ design guidelines
* `>export`, to export the code using standardized formatting
* `>trim`, to determine if an `#include` should be added or removed
* `>apply`, to modify each file using the output from `>trim` 

The output directory contains examples of the files generated by the
[`>check`](/docs/output/rsc.check.txt), [`>export`](/docs/output/rsc.lib.txt),
and [`>trim`](/docs/output/rsc.trim.txt) commands.
