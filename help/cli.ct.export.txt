The options are specified in a string that contains any of the following:
  n: namespace view: items sorted by namespace; declarations/definitions merged
  c: canonical file view: items sorted (enums-typedefs-data-functions)
  o: original file view: items in original order
  h: include class hierarchy
  s: include statistics, such as the number of reads and writes on each item
  u: display each file's symbol usage and recommended changes to #includes,
     usings, and forward declarations (in a separate .trim file)
  x: display the global cross-reference (in a separate .xref file)
If no options are entered, they default to "nchsux".  At least one option of
"ncoh" must be specified to cause the generation of the .lib file.
