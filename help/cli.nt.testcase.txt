These subcommands support test scripts and a testcase database.  The prolog,
epilog, recover, begin, end, and failed subcommands are used in test scripts.
The retest, query, erase, and reset subcommands are used to inspect and manage
the testcase database.  See also the >coverage command in the >ct increment,
which supports code coverage by making use of the testcase database.
