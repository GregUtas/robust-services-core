//  FILES IN THE subs/ DIRECTORY MUST NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE BUILD.
//
//  Parser.h may not be able to parse headers outside the code base.  However,
//  types in those headers must somehow be made visible, so they are declared
//  in subs/ files.  This way, only what the code base uses has to be parsed,
//  and the parser does not have to support C++ constructs that the code base
//  does not use.  The subs/ files also serve to document what the code base
//  actually uses.
//
//  Because the code base does not #include any subs/ files, they are compiled
//  through subs.cpp.  However, they will not get included in an actual build.
//
//  The declarations in subs/ files are often simplified versions of their true
//  counterparts and may also omit things that the code base does not use.
