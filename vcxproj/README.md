# Previous Visual Studio _vcxproj_ files

RSC now uses CMake to generate its _vcxproj_ files. The files
in this directory are those which existed _before_ migrating
to CMake.

The _vcxproj_ files now found in source code directories
were generated by CMake and are specifically for either the
Win32 or x64 target. To build for the _other_ target, you
must first run CMake to generate the _vcxproj_ files for
that target.

If you don't want to use CMake, you can set up your build
environment by copying the files in this directory to the
appropriate locations, overwriting the files that CMake
generated. A file with the name _\<dir>.*_ goes in the
_\<dir>_ source code directory. The only exception is
_rsc.sln_, which goes in the _src_ directory.
